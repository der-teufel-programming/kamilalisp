FORMS:
- Lambda expression: evaluate all arguments before calling the function.
- Macro: don't evaluate the arguments, evaluate the result. Expanded before execution.
- Special form: don't evaluate the arguments, don't evaluate the result.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
Make sure to use safeEvaluate in non-pooled threads. This will help with the exception handling.
