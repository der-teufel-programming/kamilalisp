- an idea to slightly simplify list and tree traversal: a sink data structure. you can declare
a sink at any place in the code and have some code to be evaluated in its context. then, any call
to sink:push will add the data to the sink in an impure way, regardless of where you called it but
it must be in the "sink block" and what the sink block returns is the content of the sink itself
and the return value of the code.
