- More persistent data structures?
- File/Terminal I/O functions
- More string utilities (interpolate, capitalize, etc.)
- graphics/sound, audio generation
- extend regex library
- matrix stuff
- http/https server w. routing
- more shell builtins
- unit testing
- bzip3 (needs java porting).
- GUI features.
- auto-generate the rest of SHA digest I/O streams.
- further IDE extensions/testing.
- document new features.
- cas: solve systems of equations, solve DEs, gradient, jacobian,
  compute eigenvalues, eigenvectors, solve systems of equations,
  discrete sums.
- the rest of the graph library + testing.

bugs:
- ???

book:
- huffman coding, elias gamma, histograms, fft, ski calculus, matrix algos, Chinese Remainder Theorem?

interpreter programming guidelines:
- always use absolute File-s and avoid specifying path as a string.
- always catch exceptions in new threads using safeEvaluate.
