\begin{abstract}
    This book, which means to serve as an introduction to functional and array programming utilises KamilaLisp, a Lisp-inspired dynamically typed programming language that borrows many ideas from Haskell, Standard ML, APL, Scheme and others. It is a functional programming language with a strong emphasis on array programming, and it is designed to be used in a wide range of applications. Its design stems from previous iterations, which featured more orthodox Lisp syntax, lazy evaluation and symbolic computation with an emphasis on mathematical programming.
