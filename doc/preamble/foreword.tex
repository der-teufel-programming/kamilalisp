\par KamilaLisp, the language described in the book, originates from its previous iterations - v0.1 and MalbolgeLISP. The first iteration of MalbolgeLISP (v1.0) was released in August 2020 and had very few features that distinguish KamilaLisp today. The second iteration of MalbolgeLISP (v1.1) was released in July 2021 and was the subject of much attention due to its unusual choice of implementation language. The final MalbolgeLISP (v1.2) was released in September 2021, sharing many ideas and features with KamilaLisp. Unfortunately, the effort required to implement it continued to grow. The codebase was becoming increasingly disorganised and difficult to maintain. In addition, implementing new complicated features was increasingly difficult due to the choice of implementation language. The first version of KamilaLisp, a MalbolgeLISP-inspired Lisp dialect, appeared in December 2021, featuring lazy evaluation, sophisticated numerical and symbolic operations and many original design choices borrowed from MalbolgeLISP. It is beneficial if the reader has some prior knowledge of the APL programming language (however, it is unnecessary to understand the book to its fullest). The book was written in hopes of being helpful to the determined reader to learn about the intricacies of functional and array programming.
